# Instructions

Implement a binary counter that can be incremented and decremented in steps of one.
The internal representation of the clock is a string of length 16.
After incrementing the the counter 5 times, it should for instance looks as following:
0000000000000101

Also take into account over- and underflows.
Decrementing the counter with value 0000000000000000 should result in 1111111111111111.
Incrementing the counter with value 1111111111111111 should result in 0000000000000000.
